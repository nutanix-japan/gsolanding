# Welcome to APJ CX 2023

Welcome to [Phuket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phuket_(city)), Thailand !


This landing page serves as a go to place for the agenda for the week and information regarding each individual labs and how to access them. Please take note on the pre-requisite for each lab and ensure you use the work laptop/Mac for VPN connections. For partners, please use the appropriate VPN software and credentials to access the Nutanix HPOC environment.

By now, You should have been invited to slack channels for your assigned labs. We will use the Slack channel to facilitate on-going communications.

Most of the labs have been customized for this event, as such you may encounter small errors or instructions that may not make sense. Please take this opportunity to troubleshoot before escalating; we are here to help you but we also want you to learn by exploring and troubleshooting why certain steps don't seem to work.

Lastly, this is not a competition. The labs are designed to be completed in the time frame allocated. 

Enjoy the event and especially the labs!
